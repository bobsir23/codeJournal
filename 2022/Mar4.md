# Single Responsibility Principle

Have your code be responsible for itself. DO NOT put everything on one file but split it up between multiple.

The single-responsibility principle (SRP) is a computer-programming principle that states that every module, class or function in a computer program should have responsibility over a single part of that program's functionality, and it should encapsulate that part. All of that module, class or function's services should be narrowly aligned with that responsibility.
